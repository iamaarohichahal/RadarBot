        "difference with CW": "Unlike CW radar, FMCW radar can change its operating frequency during measurement. This modulation in frequency or phase allows it to perform range measurements, which CW radar cannot do due to its inability to provide accurate timing for the transmit and receive cycle.",
        "technical feature": "FMCW radar can measure the range of targets by modulating the transmission signal in frequency or phase, creating a time reference for distance measurement through the frequency modulation of the transmitted signal.",
        "why CW cannot determine range": "Simple continuous wave radar devices cannot determine target range because they lack the timing mark necessary to accurately time the transmit and receive cycle, which is needed to convert this timing into range.",
        "frequency modulation for stationary objects": "In FMCW radar, a signal is transmitted that periodically increases or decreases in frequency. When an echo signal is received, the change in frequency experiences a delay (Î”t) due to the runtime shift, similar to pulse radar. The distance measurement is then based on the differences in phase or frequency between the transmitted and received signals.",
